# AutoMat for Godot 4 - automatically create and assign materials 

The plugin has two functions:

- Automatically find materials in the project and assign them to imported meshes

Automates the tedious steps of editing the imported mesh to assign materials, now you can just press one button and it will automatically find materials with matching name.

- Create materials from selected textures

Will create materials out of selected texture and automatically find textures starting with same name for additional shader params
